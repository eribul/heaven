Heaven includes a series of function that are useful when working with massive sized epidemiological data.  The functions are specifically constructed for the Statistics Denmark environment.  This particular environment delivers huge datasets in SAS.  Some functions are generally useful, others only helpful for datasets as delivered by Statistics Denmark.

# Overview
## Reading data
* readSAS Extract selected data from large SAS datasets. SAS does the main work in background
* importDREAM Reads the DREAM dataset regarding state subsidizing and profession
* searchEvent Search for an event in specified time period for each individual
* getAdmLimits Sets start and end to hospitalisations with multiple records
* extractCode Extraction of diseases by diagnoses

## Standardizing
* standardize.rate Standardizes rates to given age distribution
* Standardize.proportion Standardizes proportions to age distribution
* standardize.prodlim Compute standardized absolute risks based on a stratified Kaplan-Meier or Aalen-Johansen estimate

## Simulation
simpoisson Simulates data for Poisson distribution

## Matching
* riskSetMatch Risk set matching for incidense density samptling and exposure density sampling
* matchReport Provides data on matching success from riskSetMatch

## Calculation
* poissonRisk Predicting absolute risks from poisson regression
* poissonregression Aggregates data and performs poisson regression using GLM
* patientProfile Profile of common covariate combinations among patients

## Splitting 
* lexisTwo Splits by a set of covariates each causing at most one split
* lexisFromTo Splits by a series of periods - from/to
* lexisSeq Splits consecutively by a vector

#importDREAM
The DREAM dataset is collected from a range of Danish authorities.  Since 1991 it contains all residents that have received public support. Since this includes student funding from the state, prolonged sick leave, maternity leave and pension most of the Danish population is included.  The dataset is contructed with one record per person and one variable per week since 1991. For each week there is a code if that person has received support.  Further since 2008 there is a monthly recording of occupation of each individual in the dataset. For a detailed description of DREAM refer to www.dreammodel.dk

The importDREAM function reads an R data.table imported from SAS and returns a "long" list of support codes or profession codes along with person identification and dates of start and end.

## Usage
 importDREAM(dreamData,explData=NULL,type="support",pnr="PNR")
 Author: Christian Torp-Pedersen
 * dreamData Name of dataset holding DREAM data. Typically product of
 the importSAS function.  In most cases it will be useful to add a set.hook
 to the importSAS function - set.hook="keep PNR branch:" for type of work
 and set.hook="keep=PNR y_:" for support
 * explData Name of data holding relation between codes and explanatory
 text. Typically read from "//srvfsenas1/formater/SAS formater i Danmarks 
 Statistik/txt_filer" using "read.csv2".  The data is expected to hold two
 variables: the code and the explanation - in that order.  The variable
 holding the code MUST be named "branche" or "support" as appropriate.
 * type - "support" extracts weekly public support and "branche" supplies
 montly type of work. Other names cause error.
 * pnr - name of person identifier in DREAM dataset, typically "PNR"
## Return
 the function returns a data.table with the following variables:
 * pnr - person identificer from call
 * start - start of each period
 * end - end of each period
 * code - coding of period
 * explanation - text to eplain coding if a text dataset was specified

##Example
```{r}
 # The following is a minute version of DREAM
 library(data.table)
 library(heaven)
 microDREAM <-data.table(PNR=c(1,2),branche_2008_01=c("","3"),
   branche_2008_02=c("1","3"), branche_2008_03=c("1",""),
   y_9201=c("","1"),y_9202=c("","2"),y_9203=c("","2"))
 microDREAM[]
 # Explanation of codes for "branche" 
 branche <- data.table(branche=c("1","2","3"),
             text=c("school","gardening","suage"))   
 support <- data.table(support=c("1","2"),text=c("education","sick")) 
 temp <- importDREAM(microDREAM,branche,type="branche",pnr="PNR")   
 temp[]
 temp2 <- importDREAM(microDREAM,support,type="support",pnr="PNR")
 temp2[]    
```

# riskSetMatch
There are multiple good programs to perform simple matching, but few for nested case-control studies where cases and controls are selected from the sample population and an additional requirement of controls to have a particular status (no event yet / alive) at the time where the case has an event.  There are two main uses: Incidence density sampling, where controls are selected for each case at the time of outcome and where the controls should not (yet) have an event. Exposure density sampling where cases are selected at the time of exposure and controls at that time should not (yet) be exposed.

The riskSetMatch function performs exact matching on fixed variables such as sex and age (time of birth). Variables such a time of birth needs to be rounded appropriately to ensure matches. The function can also include a list of time dependent covariates where the requirement in matching is that the date of the covariate should be prior to matching date for both or later/missing for both.

The function can with input be set to reuse controls or not and to use cases as controls prior to the case date or not.  In general it i recommended to allow reuse of controls and to reuse cases prior to being a control. A review of biases is found in Robins: Biometrics, Vol. 42, No. 2 (Jun., 1986), 293-299

The riskSetMatch function is designed for very large data and uses a simplified search for controls for each case.  Lists of cases and controls are constructed - and then the controls are sorted by a random variables.  Next for each case controls are selected consecutively when they fit the matching conditions.

## Usage
    riskSetMatch(ptid,event,terms,dat,Ncontrols,oldevent="oldevent"
    ,caseid="caseid",reuseCases=FALSE,reuseControls=FALSE,caseIndex=NULL 
    ,controlIndex=NULL,NoIndex=FALSE,cores=1,dateterms=NULL)
 Author: Christian Torp-Pedersen
 * ptid  Personal ID variable defining participant
 * event Defining cases/controls MUST be integer 0/1 - 0 for controls, 1 for case
 * terms c(.....) Specifies the variables that should be matched by - 
 enclosed in ".."
 * dat The single dataset with all information - coerced to data.table
 if data.frame
 * Ncontrols  Number of controls sought for each case
 * oldevent Holds original value of event - distinguishes cases used as 
 controls
 * caseid Character. Variable holding grouping variable for 
 cases/controls (=case-ptid)
 * reuseCases Logical. If \code{TRUE} a case can be a control prior to 
 being a case
 * reuseControls Logical. If \code{TRUE} a control can be reused for 
 several cases
 * caseIndex Integer/Date. Date variable defining the date where a case 
 becomes a case. For a case control study this is the date of event of 
 interest, for a cohort study the date where a case enters an analysis.
 * controlIndex Integer/Date. date variable defining the date from which 
 a controls can no longer be selected.  The controlIndex must be larger than 
 the caseIndex.  For a case control study this would be the date where a 
 control has the event of interest or is censored.  For a cohort study it 
 would be the date where the control disappears from the analysis, e.g. due to 
 death or censoring.
 * NoIndex Logical. If \code{TRUE} caseIndex/controlIndex are ignored
 * cores number of cores to use, default is one
 * dateterms c(....) A list of variable neames (character) in "dat" 
 specifying dates of conditions. When a list is specified it is not only
 checked that the caseIndex is not after controlIndex, but also that for all
 variables in the list either both control/case dates are missing, both prior
 to case index, both after case index - or missing for case and with control
 date after case index.
 
## Details
 The function does exact matching and keeps 2 dates (indices) apart such that 
 the date for controls is larger than that for cases. Because the matching 
 is exact all matching variables must be integer or character. Make sure that
 sufficient rounding is done on continuous and semicontinuous variables to 
 ensure a decent number of controls for each case. For example it may be 
 difficult to find controls for cases of very high age and age should 
 therefore often be rounded by 2,3 or 5 years - and extreme ages further 
 aggregated.
 
 For case control studies age may be a relevant matching parameter - for most 
 cohort studies year of birth is more relevant since the age of a control 
 varies with time.
 
 Many datasets have comorbidities as time dependent variables. Matching on
 these requires that the comorbidity date is not (yet) reached for a corres-
 ponding variables for cases if the case does not have the comorbidity and 
 similarly that the date has been reached when the case does have that co-
 morbidity.
 
 For many purposes controls should be reused and cases allowed to be controls 
 prior to being cases. By default, there is no reuse and this can be adjusted 
 with "reuseCases" and "reuseControls"
 
 The function can be used for standard matching without the caseIndex/
 controlIndex (with "NoIndex"), but other packages such as MatchIt are more 
 likely to be more optimal for these cases.
 
 It may appear tempting always to use multiple cores, but this comes with a 
 costly overhead because the function machinery has to be distributed to each 
 defined "worker".  With very large numbers of cases and controls, multiple
 cores can save substantial amounts of time. When a single core is used a 
 progress shows progress of matching. There is no progress bar with multiple 
 cores
 
 The function matchReport may afterwards be used to provide simple summaries 
 of use of cases and controls
## Return
 data.table with cases and controls. After matching, a new variable 
 "caseid" links controls to cases. Further, a variable "oldevent" holds the 
 orginal value of "event" - to be used to identify cases functioning
 as controls prior to being cases.
 
 Variables in the original dataset are preserved. The final dataset includes 
 all original cases but only the controls that were selected. 
 
 If cases without controls should be removed, this is done by setting the
 variable removeNoControls to TRUE
```{r} 
## Example
 library(data.table)
 library(heaven)
 case <- c(rep(0,40),rep(1,15)) 
 ptid <- paste0("P",1:55)
 sex <- c(rep("fem",20),rep("mal",20),rep("fem",8),rep("mal",7))
 byear <- c(rep(c(2020,2030),20),rep(2020,7),rep(2030,8))
 case.Index <- c(seq(1,40,1),seq(5,47,3))
 control.Index <- case.Index
 diabetes <- seq(2,110,2)
 heartdis <- seq(110,2,-2)
 diabetes <- c(rep(1,55))
 heartdis <- c(rep(100,55))
 dat <- data.table(case,ptid,sex,byear,diabetes,heartdis,case.Index,control.Index)
 # Very simple match without reuse - no dates to control for
 out <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,NoIndex=TRUE)
 head(out,10)
 # Risk set matching without reusing cases/controls - 
 # Some cases have no controls
 out2 <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,caseIndex="case.Index",
   controlIndex="control.Index")
 head(out2,10) 
 # Risk set matching with reuse of cases (control prior to case) and reuse of 
 # controls - more cases get controls
 out3 <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,caseIndex=
   "case.Index",controlIndex="control.Index"
   ,reuseCases=TRUE,reuseControls=TRUE)
 head(out3,10)  
 # Same with 2 cores
 out4 <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,caseIndex=
   "case.Index",controlIndex="control.Index"
   ,reuseCases=TRUE,reuseControls=TRUE,cores=2)  
 head(out4,10)   
 #Time dependent matching. In addtion to fixed matching parameters there are
 #two other sets of dates where it is required that if a case has that condi-
 #tion prior to index, then controls also need to have the condition prior to
 #the case index to be eligible - and if the control does not have the condi-
 #tion prior to index then the same is required for the control.
 out5 <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,caseIndex=
   "case.Index",controlIndex="control.Index"
   ,reuseCases=TRUE,reuseControls=TRUE,cores=1,
   dateterms=c("diabetes","heartdis"))  
 head(out5,10)
 #POSTPROCESSING
 #It may be convinient to add the number of controls found to each case in or-
 #der to remove cases without controls or where very few controls have been
 #found.  This is easily obtained using data.table - with the example above:
 #out5[,numControls:=.N,by=caseid] # adds a column with the number of controls
                                  # for each case-ID   

```
# matchReport
This function is to be applied to the output from riskSetMatch and provides tabulation of uses and reuses of controls and cases

## Usage
 matchReport(dat, id, case, caseid,oldcase="oldevent") 
 * dat - data.table with result from riskSetMatch
 * id - variable with participant id
 * case - 0=control, 1=case
 * caseid - variable defining the groups of matching cases/controls
 * oldcase - Variable holding case/control=0/1 prior to matching. Distinguishes
 cases reused as controls
 Author:  Christian Torp-Pedersen
 
## Details 
 This function can be helpful to define matching options.  If there is excessive reuse of controls or many
 cases do not find controls it may be desirable to do further rounding of matching variables.
 Return:  Three small tables - Number of controls for cases, use/reuse of controls, use/reuse of cases
## Example
```{r}
 require(data.table)
 case <- c(rep(0,40),rep(1,15)) 
 ptid <- paste0("P",1:55)
 sex <- c(rep("fem",20),rep("mal",20),rep("fem",8),rep("mal",7))
 byear <- c(rep(c(2020,2030),20),rep(2020,7),rep(2030,8))
 caseIndex <- c(seq(1,40,1),seq(5,47,3))
 controlIndex <- caseIndex
 library(data.table)
 dat <- data.table(ptid,case,sex,byear,caseIndex,controlIndex)
 # Very simple match without reuse - no dates to control for
 dataout <- riskSetMatch("ptid","case",c("byear","sex"),dat,2,caseIndex="caseIndex",
   controlIndex="controlIndex",reuseCases=TRUE,reuseControls=TRUE)
 matchReport(dataout,"ptid","case","caseid")   
``` 
 
# Lexis functions 
The lexis functions are 3 functions to aid splitting of observations in order to perform time varying analyses. To understand the functionality the following graph is a lexis diagram.

![](~/github/heaven/images/lexisdiagram.png)

The diagram shows time passing for a number of individual by age and calender time. Some have an event (red x) and som not.  For time dependent analysis individuals are split by calender time and age. The individual most to the right is split in 5 records, the split occurring each time a line is crossed. This allows regression to be time dependent with individuals contributing to different age/time periods and only be compared with other individuals in the same age/time period.

In practice a rage of splits are performed:
* Comorbidities: These are most often used to split a single time, the date of the comorbidity
* Period effects: For drug treatment, pregnancies and many other situations there are periods where individuals are in one state and other periods with other states - such a pregnancy, dose of a drug etc.
* Sequential splits: As shown in the lexis diagram
